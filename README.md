# Description 


The website we developed doesnt need anything to download. When we were finaly able to deploy it its simple to use. There is a simplicity to the way when you search for a city in the Bay Area you get the listings of a couple of apartment buildings and phone number of the listing persons number, the adress and the size of the rooms. 



# Functionality 

The person that visits our website will be able to search for any City in the Bay Area then when they search, they will display a couple of types of apartment in the Bay Area acoriding to the city of their choice. They will then be able to see a photo of the building and be able to see what kind of apartments there are here in the Bay. The other part of the website would also display near by places liek groceries for the place you would choose. 


# Process 

We began by brainstorming ideas about what kind of website we could do that could be interesting. We listed of our interests and it was from there that we decided after going through those ideas that a Real Estate website that displays apartments sounded simple enough and would fulfil some of the requirments. The API database we used was from RAPID API - it included real estate from cities we would search up. It was free and simple enough to use. Another API we used was the Trueways- nearby places API. 

We were able to get the ball rolling pretty quick the API allowed up to 20-50 searches for free so we kept that in mind, and created the html,js, & style. We used Bootstrap fulfiled the two API requirements and got the website to work through GitHub pages. 



# Work Split Evenly 

Since we only had two people in the group we split the work up between eachother. The HTML/Styling/Keeping the github side updated was Srikars role. The JavaScript and also with overall help in editing was Andys role.
